## General info
Mindex Benchmark is a code prototype project featuring a 2D game that tests your reflex, reaction time, speed, and precision.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Pygame-CE version: 2.5.6
* Python3 version: 3.13.7
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code

## Setting up Pygame
Pygame is included as part of the Python package when downloaded.
1. Head to Python.org on your browser
2. Navigate to Downloads.
3. **CRUCIAL STEP:** Search for Python 3.13.9 (Please ignore 3.14.0 when prompted, as this version is not compatible with Pygame yet).
4. **CRUCIAL STEP:** Once the download window has appeared, ensure that "Use admin privileges when installing py.exe" and "Add python.exe to PATH" is selected, then click "Install now".
5. Once all processes are complete, close the download window.
6. Depending on your OS, open either in the Windows home or Mac's Launchpad, type "cmd" or "terminal" respectively.
7. Type "pip install pygame-ce", press enter, and wait for the download to complete.
8. Your system is now set up with Pygame's library!

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code Setup:
Compatible with any IDE, but Microsoft Visual Studio Code is recommended for instructional purposes.
1. Download Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
2. Once you have opened Microsoft Visual Studio Code, navigate to the Extensions option on the left-hand side of the menu (the icon of 3 stacked blocks with one rotated).
3. Search "Python", and select the "Python" package verified by Microsoft's blue tick.
4. Click on install.

## Downloading and acccessing the game project
6. Once that is done, download the zip file of this project, "Mindex Benchmark (Laptop Scaled)".
7. Open the zip file, and either drag and drop or unzip it to a folder you can access later.
8. In Microsoft Visual Studio Code, navigate to the "File" option in the bar at the very top.
9. Select "Open Folder", and access Mindex Benchmark's file.

## To Play:
You can select main_menu to start the game from the Main Menu screen. Alternatively, you can access target_clicking and decision_making as separate scripts as well.

To run the script, click on the small triangle on the top right corner that should say "Run Python File in Dedicated Terminal" when hovered over.

Your points will be printed to the console at the bottom of your screen upon each session completing.
